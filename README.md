<h2>Countries App</h2>
<p>
I decided to make Countries App to challenge myself a little more on the challenges I had already done. First I had the idea of making an app that consults an API and makes filters with an "infinite" scroll, just like Instagram, but after thinking about it I realized that I had already executed this in previous projects, so I decided to execute something a little more complex and from here this app was born ‚ù§Ô∏è. While I've worked on projects with Login/Registration before, I've never done it entirely on my own, and I've never made a game, which is something I've wanted to do for a long time. I explain the idea of the app in my LinkedIn video. But I leave you a link to the project with the readme that explains all its great features.
PS: I plan to keep updating this project. üöÄ </p>
<p> Basically it is an application that makes requests to a backend that makes requests to an api.
It has functionality for filtering, creating, deleting and updating information.
Among them a login / registration, creator of "countries", update of user information, update of user quiz points.
I think its greatest attraction is its game, it is "QuizCountries", a very fun and entertaining Trivia Crack game that rewards its users with badges.

<p>I also leave you some photos of the application working:</p>
